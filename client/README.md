# EasyGenerators Frontend Documentation

## Overview
The frontend for the EasyGenerators project is built using **React**, with **Vite** as the build tool for faster development. It uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, providing a clean and modern user interface. The frontend handles authentication, navigation, and private route protection, interacting with the backend through secure APIs.
